print("I love learning Python")


# Print Practice #2

print("Learning with 'TOTAL Python' is super fun!")
print(f"Learning with 'TOTAL Python' is super fun!")


# Print Practice #3
# Write Python code that prints the number 555 to the screen as a result of a mathematical expression

# Find 3 objects around the room and create variables from it,
# Insert those variables into an f-string sentence(look at slide 22)in repl.it
Object1= "Headphones"
Object2 = "Phone"
Object3 = "Computer" 
print(f"I like to use my {Object1}. I also use my {Object2} and {Object3}.")

# Familiarize yourself with the syntax of the print() function.
# Print your name.
name = "Isabella"
print(f"My name is {name}.")

# Print today's date.
date = "10/30"
print(f"Today is {date}.")

# Print the name of your favorite movie.
favorite_movie = "Wall-E" 
print(f"My favorite movie is {favorite_movie}")
# Print your name and age on separate lines using a single print() function.
name = "Isabella"
age = 16

print(f"My name is {name}, and I am {age}.")

# Use f-strings to print a message like: "In 10 years, [Your Name] will be [Your Age + 10] years old."
num1 = 16
num2 = 10
print(f"In 10 years, {name} will be 26")

###########################String Practice##################################
#syntax is the way we write code
# print("Hello World")
print("Hello world!")

# name = "John"
name = "John"

#in other languages, this is different
# in javascript for example, you define
#variables with let or const or var
#in python, you just give your variables a
#name and then define it with a value


#challenge
# find a summary of the movie blue beetle online and create a 
# variable called blue_beetle_summary and print it it out to the screen

# print the length of the summary
# upper case the entire summary
# print the summary
# print the summary in lowercase
# replace the word blue with red
# print the summary
# string index the word beetle and print it out
# print the last word of the summary
# print the summary in reverse


##########################input practice#############################################
#input is when we ask the user for input/data
# Ask the user to enter their name.

# Input Practice #1
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# What are you learning today?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

# Input Practice #2
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# Where are you from?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

# Input Practice #3
# Write Python code that displays the user's full name on the screen, by allowing them to enter their first and last name with the following instructions:
# What is your name?
# What is your surname?
# The code must be able to print the user's first and last name on the screen, separated by a space.
