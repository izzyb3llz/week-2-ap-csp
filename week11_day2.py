# open up the vscode from previous day
# create a new file called: week11_day1.py

# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Isabella"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Yellow"
favorite_number = 13

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("My name is " + first_name + " and my favorite color is " + favorite_color)

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
x=2
print(f"Addition: {x+favorite_number}" )
print(f"Division: {favorite_number/x}")

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
question = input("What is your name?")
question2 = input("What is your name?")

print(question + question2)

num3 = int(input("number 3 please"))
num4 = int(input("number 4 please"))
print(num3 + num4)
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
